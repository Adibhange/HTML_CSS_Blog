					<h3>
						Portuguese heritage colony in Fontainhas - Heritage Walk in Goa
					</h3>
					<p>
						A heritage walk in Fontainhas, the Portuguese colony of Goa, was a
						journey back in time. It gave me a sense of appreciation for the
						passion of the state to keep the legacy alive. Goa has a history of
						being ruled by various empires which resulted into a rare cultural
						heritage influenced by Indians, Mughals and Catholic Portuguese
						which reflects in the lifestyle of Goans.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fontainhas is a heritage colonial quarter in the centre of Panjim,
						where the influential Portuguese rulers lived. The Portuguese style
						old villas and buildings with overhanging balconies in the narrow
						and winding lanes reflect the old European architecture. The blue,
						yellow and green coloured houses make up a vibrant and cheerful
						locality.

						I was quite impressed to see few passionate Goans who took a stand

						some way. They believe in preserving the past to enrich the future.

					<h3>One Day In Milan: Highlights For Your First Visit</h3>
					<p>
						Traditionally, Milan has a reputation for being all about business,
						foggy sky, and fancy clothes, but it is finally emerging as a
						vibrant, cosmopolitan center. See, the thing with Milan is that it
						is pretty shy and reveals its beauty only to the curious traveler.
						It is amazing how our perception of a place can change as soon as we
						venture into a side street!
					</p>
					<p>
						the starting point is Milano Centrale, the city has key
						transportation hub and the first thing most people see when they
						arrive in Milan. It is a beautiful train station, the second-largest
						in Italy in terms of size and traffic, and behind its massive
						concrete facade hides beautiful marbles and architectural details.
						You will find yourself snapping pictures as soon as you hop off the
						train!

					<h3>The Heart of Paris: Discovering the Eiffel Tower</h3>
					<p>
						In this blog, I will tell you the most important things you will
						need to know to enjoy the Eiffel Tower on your trip to Paris.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Champs-de-Mars and the Trocad√©ro, the areas surrounding the
						tower, provide almost unobstructed views of the tower from the base
						of the pillars up to the pinnacle. Sit for a spell in the grass and
						people watch before your ascent to get even more excited, or unwind
						there after your climb.It took a team of 50 engineers and designers
						and around 500 offsite and onsite workers two years, two months, and
						five days to get the Iron Lady ready for her debut at the World is
						Fair in 1889.

						It is strange to imagine the Eiffel Tower was actually once
						considered an eyesore, unwanted by a large contingent of Parisians.
						The ‚Äúwho is who‚Äù of the day drafted The Protestation des Artistes, a
						protest against the tower of Monsieur Eiffel.

					<h3>
						Turkey's Turquoise Coast: A Magical Weekend In Fethiye & Ol√ºdeniz
					</h3>
					<p>
						Once known as the ancient city of Telmessos, Fethiye was a key city
						in the Lycian civilization. It was famous for its school of
						diviners, visited by people like Alexander the Great
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the coolest things to do along the coast is seek out various
						Lycian rock tombs. There are many around, but the Tomb of Amyntas is
						right there at the edge of town in Fethiye so it's a must-visit. It
						wasn't a bad walk from my hotel, about 20-25 minutes and I was able
						to walk along the promenade and see the Paspatur street on my way.
						It is an uphill hike‚Äîbut the views are worth it!
